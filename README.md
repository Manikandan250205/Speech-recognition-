A speech recognition system is a technology that enables computers and devices to interpret and process human speech into text or executable commands. It plays a crucial role in modern human-computer interaction, allowing users to interact with machines naturally using spoken language.The system captures spoken words using a microphone or audio input device. The quality of the recording significantly impacts accuracy, as background noise, accents, and pronunciation variations can affect recognition.The captured audio is converted into a digital format, and the system analyzes features such as pitch, frequency, and phonemes. Techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Spectrogram Analysis help extract meaningful features from speech signals.These models link audio signals to phonetic units, helping the system understand speech sounds. They are trained using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
